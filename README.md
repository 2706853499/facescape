# FaceScape

This is the project page for our paper "FaceScape: a Large-Scale High Quality 3D Face Dataset and Detailed Riggable 3D Face Prediction", which will appear in CVPR 2020.  

The website of FaceScape is online: https://facescape.nju.edu.cn/.  We recommend browsing on PC using Chrome/Firefox.  Currently, 3D models are available for application and download, and multi-view image data will be released in the near future.  Because face data involves the privacy of participants, we use strict license terms to ensure that the data is not abused. Please visit https://facescape.nju.edu.cn/Page_Download/ for data access.

**Tip: We find that many of our replies are mislabeled as spam, so if you don't get a response more than 24 hours after your application (on a working day), please check the spam box.  Thanks!**


FaceScape dataset contains 18,760 textured 3D faces, captured from 938 subjects and each with 20 specific expressions. The 3D models contain high-quality facial geometry that is also processed to be topologically uniformed.  Please refer to [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13989) for more details.
